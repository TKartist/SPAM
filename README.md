## Overview

Your active website may receive large amount of information from the users which may be hard to analyze through
man-power; hence, there may be a need for sentiment analysis on the qualitative data received from the user.
One method to analyze this qualitative information may be LLMs but due to privacy issues the use of LLM
is severely restricted. To evade this issue, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and pre-existing
libraries can be used to capture user sentiment OR identify commonly occuring issues.
