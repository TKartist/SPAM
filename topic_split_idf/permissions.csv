1680,"Access denied shows onscreen before the Flash Update page loads properly### Page URL

https://go.ifrc.org/flash-updates/364

### Environment

Production

### Browser

Chrome

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

1. Be logged in as a user that has permission to view Flash Updates
2. navigate to a particular Flash Update page (either from the link on the [Emergencies page](https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies), or by directly pasting the URL such as https://go.ifrc.org/flash-updates/363

### Expected Behavior

I expected the Flash Update page to load fine

### Actual Behavior

When the page first started loading I saw a 403 permission denied screen, only after that did the page load correctly.

I've tried several times - sometimes the 403 appears only for a tiny fraction of a second, sometimes it appears for longer - but in either case it's an awkward user experience that we need to fix to ensure users don't think something is wrong with the platform!

### Priority

Low (Minor inconvenience)

### Additional Context (Optional)

The page does load correctly, it's just the intermediate phase while loading that the error shows.  The error shows onscreen for longer the slower the internet/longer the latency.",0.14469731100760266
