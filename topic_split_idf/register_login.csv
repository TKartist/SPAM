611,"[PROD] can't reset password with a username - even though it says I can## Issue
I had to reset my password - so went to https://go.ifrc.org/recover-account

My user is from the days when username is not the same as email address.  The screen says I should ""Enter the email/username you used during registration"" - so I did, however it gave me a message saying ""That email is not associated with a user"".
I could reset the password fine if I put my email address in (it just meant I had to remember which email address I had registered with... I had a note of my username but not which email address it related to).

Anyway, need to make sure the message onscreen matches what the user can actually do - either allow them to enter their username or remove reference to the username on the screen.

Thanks


## Impact
People who registered prior to the change to username approach

## Is there a workaround?
If people figure out that email will work, then they can enter their email address

855,"[PROD] Login Error Message Is Not Accurate## Issue
Users receive the 'Invalid username or password' error, even when their account is not active. 

## Steps to reproduce
You need two GO user accounts (A1 and A2), and their passwords. One of the accounts should have admin permission (A1).
1. Login to the goadmin page with the account A1, go to the users section, search the user account A2, and uncheck the 'Active' box
2. Login to the go page with the account A2, and try to login with its credentials
3. You will receive the 'Invalid username or password'*

## Expected behaviour
Display to the user a message saying ""Your account is deactivated, contact the IM team at im@ifrc.org for more information.""

## Impact
 We usually receive more than one message per week, of users trying multiple times to reset their passwords not successfully.

## Severity
They can not log in to GO.

## Is there a workaround?
They contact im@ifrc.org

The user reports that they were using Safari.
They subsequently tried loading GO using Google Chrome and could access it fine.

The user is therefore not blocked  - and I have only seen it from one user - however thought it worth logging a ticket in case this is something that needs to be fixed.
