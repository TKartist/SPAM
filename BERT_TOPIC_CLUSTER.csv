"3w - Integrate FDRS data disaggregation on 3w population figures
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, GO 3w allows National Societies to submit population figures within a 3w project, either for people targeted or people reached. Disaggregation figures available in GO are basic: Male, Female, and Other. 
One of the recommendations provided by Geneva FDRS team, was to align the disaggregation approach with FDRS platform. National Societies report in FDRS on an annual basis, following special disaggregation principles and guidelines, particularly when reporting population figures. 
GO 3w to be aligned with FDRS in regards disaggregation in population figures, allowing National Societies to report on a single structure in both platforms, and avoiding extra steps and time with additional calculations.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To agree on additional data points needed to align with FDRS population figures, and include them in GO 3w.
To revise current data points (People Targeted - Male, People Targeted - Female, People Targeted - Other, People Reached - Male, People Reached - Female, People Reached - Other) and integrate FDRS population figures in gender, disabilities, and age groups (if applicable).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
*A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.*

**Additional context**
Potential changes in data structure in regards population figures. It may need to expand/add age groups, population with disabilities, and gender disaggregation. This may affect current data points, and will need to modify current 3w records/submissions.

**Where does the data come from and how is it maintained?**
3w data comes from National Societies, Partner National Societies and IFRC sectoral leads. It is maintained by themselves.

**Should there be any restrictions around viewing or updating information related to this feature**
*any considerations around permissions e.g. public vs only logged-in RCRC users should be able to see this*

"Add linkage to information about IFRC event leveling (i.e. Crisis Categorisation)

Feature request to add contextual information to the disaster categorization field.

I've spoken to users that are confused about the ""Disaster Categorization"" field under Emergency Overview on emergency pages.

"Remove all unbounded API calls from frontend
There are still a few places on the frontend where we make unbounded API calls (i.e. where we set the `limit` parameter to the API to a really high number to ensure we fetch ""all"" results"") instead of paginating through API responses and fetching a sane amount, say 100, elements at a time.

This is a blocker to us removing support for high `limit` values on the API - ideally, we would lock-down the API to not allow more than, say, 200 items in a single request. 

We need to:

 - [ ] Identify all places in the frontend code where we make unbounded calls
 - [ ] Look for ways to change the logic to not need an unbounded call
 - [ ] For cases where we do need to fetch ""all"" items, implement request pagination on the frontend, similar to how we are handling CSV downloads on the frontend now.
 - [ ] Once the above is done, give warning to all API users, and then implement a `limit` restriction on the API.

I can start enumerating places where we are making unbounded calls on the frontend.

"[PROD] Login Error Message Is Not Accurate
## Issue
Users receive the 'Invalid username or password' error, even when their account is not active. 

## Steps to reproduce
You need two GO user accounts (A1 and A2), and their passwords. One of the accounts should have admin permission (A1).
1. Login to the goadmin page with the account A1, go to the users section, search the user account A2, and uncheck the 'Active' box
2. Login to the go page with the account A2, and try to login with its credentials
3. You will receive the 'Invalid username or password'*

## Expected behaviour
Display to the user a message saying ""Your account is deactivated, contact the IM team at im@ifrc.org for more information.""

## Impact
 We usually receive more than one message per week, of users trying multiple times to reset their passwords not successfully.

## Severity
They can not log in to GO.

## Is there a workaround?

"[PROD] Ensure Appeals always have a country associated
Yesterday, we had an error on production after an Appeal was ingested without having a Country attached. We need to make sure this cannot happen again.

If it is legitimate / possible that Appeals can be without a Country, then we should make sure the frontend does not fail if an Appeal is missing a Country.

However, I think in all likelihood, we just want to ensure on the backend that this cannot happen that an Appeal is created without a Country.

We should probably:

 - Remove the `null=True` for country on the Appeal model, so that the database does not allow null values: https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-api/blob/develop/api/models.py#L895 - this will require checking all existing appeals in the database and writing a migration if needed.
 - During the Appeal ingestion script, if the incoming data does not have a country attached to the appeal or the country lookup fails, output an error log, but do not attempt to insert that record into the database. For that I guess here instead of returning a `None` country, we should raise an exception: https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-api/blob/develop/api/management/commands/ingest_appeals.py#L191 and I guess catch the exception here and just skip inserting this record in case of failing country lookup: https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-api/blob/develop/api/management/commands/ingest_appeals.py#L206 ?

We should discuss this - if we think that we want to continue allowing Null values for country on the backend in case the country look-up fails, then we would need to rather make changes on the client to deal with null values for country.

For this particular Appeal where we had the country come in as null, we should investigate why that happened: was this information missing in the upstreeam data, or did we fail to match the country code correctly, or .. ?

"Surge Gantt chart: Minor issues
Noting down some issues with the Surge Gantt chart, for example on this page: https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/6700/surge

 - The line representing ""today"" is missing a label -- space is a bit crunched, but it would be nice to have a label indicating what that line is - I think we used to show the current date above that line.
 - Problems with pagination: So, on the old site, we did not do pagination on this Surge table in order to have the Gantt chart in one place. The idea with the Gantt chart is that you want to see all the deployments from the first to the last of an operation in one place - i.e. the start date should represent the start date of the first deployment to the operation and the end date the last date of the last operation. Currently, with the pagination, it shows the start and end dates for ""deployments on this page"" rather than overall start and end dates.
 
 My recommendation for this would be to just not paginate on the Surge Deployments table on the Emergencies page. From conversations, it would be rare to have a very large number of deployments for an emergency, and I don't see how we could make the Gantt chart realistically work while maintaining pagination.

Let me know if that makes sense. @anamariaescobar @frozenhelium ",https://api.github.com/repos/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/382,-1,"[0.00638987 0.01514879 0.01662779 0.0084653  0.01070703 0.08933474

"Integrate Storybook for Component Development and Capturing UI Feedbacks
### Feature Request

To streamline and improve the development process of UI components within GO, we propose the integration of Storybook. Storybook is a powerful tool that allows developers to build and visualize UI components in isolation, facilitating efficient development, testing, and collaboration. This will also help us capture most of the visual feedback from the designers and separate UI issues in the web app or the components library.

### Why Storybook?
1. Isolation and Development Efficiency
    Issue: Working on UI components within the context of the entire application can be time-consuming and cumbersome.
    Solution: Storybook allows developers to isolate and work on individual UI components independently, leading to faster development cycles and more focused debugging.

2. Visual Prototyping and Iteration
Issue: Prototyping and iterating on UI designs can be challenging when closely tied to the application flow.
Solution: Storybook provides a visual playground for rapid prototyping, enabling developers and designers to iterate on UI components efficiently and visualize different states and variations.

3. Documentation and Component Showcase
Issue: Documentation of UI components is often scattered or embedded within the codebase, making it challenging for team members to understand and utilize them.
Solution: Storybook acts as a centralized platform for documenting and showcasing UI components, making it easier for team members to discover, understand, and use components consistently.

4. Collaboration and Communication
Issue: Communicating and collaborating on UI components can be challenging without a visual representation.
Solution: Storybook fosters collaboration by providing an interactive environment where team members can visually assess, discuss, and align on UI component behavior and design.

5. Testing and Debugging:
Issue: Identifying and fixing issues within UI components can be time-consuming when testing in the context of the entire application.
Solution: Storybook simplifies testing and debugging by allowing developers to focus on individual components in isolation, streamlining the troubleshooting process.

### Proposal
This feature will include the setup and configuration of Storybook within GO, the migration of existing components, and writing stories for each component.

### Expected Benefits
1. Develop and test UI components more efficiently by leveraging the isolation provided by Storybook.
2. Enhance team collaboration through visual representation and discussion of UI components in Storybook.]
3. Use Storybook as a central repository for documenting and showcasing UI components, ensuring consistent and up-to-date information.
4. Improve prototyping and iteration of UI components by utilizing Storybook's visual environment.

"3W Activity UX Issues
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Following UX issues cause struggle or confusion to users submitting a new [3W activity](https://go.ifrc.org/three-w/activities/new):

1. After selecting the operation, the corresponding country isn't prefilled automatically.
2. After selecting at least one sector under ""Types of Actions Taken"", there's an exclamation message saying ""There should be at least one activity in selected sectors.""
3. After selecting an activity under a sector, its corresponding data entry fields are not expanded automatically, increasing the likelihood of the end-user ignoring them and instead just hitting the Submit button. Furthermore, it's not possible to expand the activity's data entry fields by e.g. clicking on its name.
4. After leaving the number of people reached empty and hitting submit, the error message occupies the fields the person is supposed to fill, making it impossible to enter any numbers in those fields. Furthermore, the ""No data on people reached"" toggle isn't visible until you try to submit with empty numbers.
5. After pressing submit (of a properly filled activity), the popup shows some non-escaping (nbsp) characters.
6. After pressing submit on the pop-up, the toast alert message shows placeholder text (missing [strings](https://goadmin.ifrc.org/en/admin/lang/string/?q=alertMessageSuccessful)). Additionally, the ""Last modified"" text shows ""unknown user"".

**Describe the solution you'd like**
1. The country should be automatically filled if the operation is single-country (like most are).
2. It would be better to have the message in the corresponding sector's Activities list and be something more user-friendly, e.g. ""Please select at least one activity"". See the attached screenshot 2 for more details.
3. Every activity's data entry fields should be auto-expanded after selecting them under each selected sector. Additionally, users should be able to expand/contract the fields by clicking anywhere on the corresponding activity's field. See the attached screenshot 3 for more details.
4. The error message shouldn't prevent the user from filling in the numbers. Additionally, the ""No data on people reached"" toggle should be visible already when filling out the form (i.e., not only after trying to submit). See the attached screenshots 4a and 4b for more details.
5. The non-breaking space characters should be escaped properly.
6. Placeholder text should be properly populated, e.g. ""3W activity submitted successfully"". Also, the ""Last modified"" text should show the name of the person who modified it last. See the attached screenshot 6 for more details.

"Implement anchors so I can directly link to specific parts of a page
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Usability:  Many GO pages have multiple sections, and it's useful to be able to provide people with a link that takes them directly to that part of the page.  My example today is that I want to share the IM Technical Competency Framework that was added via https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/566 - but I can't link directly to the Competency Framework heading.

Previous example from a while back was wanting to link directly to Appeal Documents (which can often be below ~6 other sections on the Reports/Documents page). https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-frontend/issues/1012#issuecomment-615147155

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Sections of the page have anchors that I can hover over and get a link - like in many other sites - e.g. this from https://developers.google.com/style/headings-targets
<img width=""302"" alt=""image (2)"" src=""https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/assets/33625192/846959b6-e90b-4dc3-87d4-5cc007bf6846"">

highlight any text on the page and right click then choose ""Copy link to highlight"".  All it does is search for the text - so if the text appears multiple times it will highlight it multiple times - e.g.
https://go.ifrc.org/surge/catalogue/information-management#:~:text=IM%20Coordinator has multiple results - but this hack is useful in cases where the text is highly specific and only appears once on the page.  It's not intuitive for non-geeks though.

"[PROD] can't reset password with a username - even though it says I can
## Issue
I had to reset my password - so went to https://go.ifrc.org/recover-account

My user is from the days when username is not the same as email address.  The screen says I should ""Enter the email/username you used during registration"" - so I did, however it gave me a message saying ""That email is not associated with a user"".
I could reset the password fine if I put my email address in (it just meant I had to remember which email address I had registered with... I had a note of my username but not which email address it related to).

Anyway, need to make sure the message onscreen matches what the user can actually do - either allow them to enter their username or remove reference to the username on the screen.

Thanks


## Impact
People who registered prior to the change to username approach

## Is there a workaround?
If people figure out that email will work, then they can enter their email address

## Expected behaviour
The search should return identical results regardless of the accents.

## Impact
There are many search results for country names with and without accents, so users might not realise they're missing part of the search results with their search string. The impact is further exacerbated by legacy country names (`Turkey`, `Turkiye`, and `Türkiye` all return different results). 

## Severity
TBD.

## Is there a workaround?
None identified.

"Search result page improvements 
There are opportunities to improve the search result page based on user feedback and internal review:
https://go.ifrc.org/search?
- [ ] Accents in search terms #621 
- [ ] Emergencies table should have 'Start date' attribute (first column)
- [ ] When I search for country name, it doesn't find new emergencies, as those have iso3 code in the title. Same happens with Reports
- [ ] Secondary default sorting of Emergencies should be the start date (e.g. when I search for a country, emergencies in the country should be listed by start date (descending))
- [ ] When user lists all results in a section (e.g. View all results for Emergencies), lists should be sortable by column
- [x] Ongoing RR Deployments section: it should only show Ongoing deployments #633 
- [x] Open Surge Alerts section: currently it shows archived, unfilled, closed alerts. It should only show open Alerts
- [ ] GO page: frequently asked feature is to be able to search for pages on GO. e.g. find pages under Surge Catalogue of Services

- [ ] When searching for 'Afghanistan', two regions are listed (MENA and Africa), while the country is in APAC
- [ ] Browser back button behavior https://github.com/orgs/IFRCGo/projects/12/views/1?filterQuery=is%3Aopen+search&pane=issue&itemId=24220194

"[PROD] erroneous link to EAPs from Risk Watch pages
## Issue
On the Risk Watch page of any country (whether or not that country has an Early Action Protocol) there's a big red button saying ""Download the EAP"".
If I click that button I get taken to https://www.ifrc.org/appeals?date_from=&date_to=&type%5B%5D=30&appeal_code=&text= which has ""Forecast based early action protocol"" prepopulated - but when I hit Search on that page there are no results.

## Expected behaviour
Ideally the button should only show if the NS does in fact have an EAP - however if it was decided that the button should show regardless of the presence or otherwise of an EAP then the link should take me to a place where I can see the EAP.

I am not an EAP expert but I *suspect* that the document type desired here should be ""Early Action Protocol summary"" (i.e. `&type%5B%5D=6545` ) instead

"DREF forms - Detailed error messages needed
When there is a DREF form submission error message, the pop-up message is a generic error message. It doesn't help the users to resolve the problem by themselves. Many of the issues could be resolved by the user easily, if more info would be shared with them about the problem and resolution. We should have more detailed messages such as we have for field reports.

E.g.: error log shows: `\"":{\""source_information\"":[{},{},{\""source_link\"":[\""Ensure this field has no more than 255 characters.\` - the error message should indicate the form field and explain the problem.

"SitRep Feed
Sharing an idea from Alexei from BRC. He's proposing a view in the front end that serves as a feed of all SitReps (basically anything from the /situation_report/ endpoint, akin to how [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/updates) does it. 

I imagine it would make sense to have this be both a complete feed in chronological order and also be filterable by emergency, emergency type, region, country, etc.

Since documents' locations seem to be stored with either the `document` or `document_url` key, I think the solution here would just require a simple if/else across those two fields.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
*When open an emergency page, show the map from a minimum zoom level. If on that level, have the map centered around the affected area.*

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- *Have a message on the page saying that in order to see the affected area, you need to zoom in.*
- *Have the affected areas shown always, no matter how far you zoom out. > Issue with showing adm1 data ... *

**Additional context**
*Two examples:*
*[Example 1: Russia floods](https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/6937/details): In order to see the affected area, zoom in 2x and then move right on the map*
*[Example 2: Russia Shooting](https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/6932/details): In order to see the affected area, zoom in 2x*

"Have link to communication guidelines on Field Report submit page
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Field reports can be submitted by NSs themselves. NSs might have a different ideas on language what is appropriate. We need to have some general communication guidelines how to phrase things (or how not) so it adheres to our principles of neutrality and independence. There should be a link to these guidelines when submitting a Field Report.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
On the create field report page a clear link to the communication guidelines. With a message that, IFRC has the right to depublish a field report when it is not in line with these guidelines.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Having the guidelines shown and you need to click on ""Yes, I agree"" in order to go further. > This is making it too cumbersome.

**Where does the data come from and how is it maintained?**

**Should there be any restrictions around viewing or updating information related to this feature**

"Active alert going out to GO-managers if potential sensitive text is posted on GO
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Non-IFRC staff can submit Field Reports (and operations, etc). Monitoring of the submitted texts is by discretion of the regional offices. This might not be done very often. Therefore, there can be texts posted on GO which are political sensitive and could cause some uproar (as we've seen in the past). The GO-managers need to get notified on texts that are questionable regarding the wording/phrasing, so they can take action immediately. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Have a black-list of words/phrases. If a text (title, bodytext, etc) contains any of the words, the entry should be flagged and be hidden until a GO-manager has approved the entry. If this happens, the GO-manager should get an email with an action item to review the entry and to approve or disapprove it.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
*A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.*

**Additional context**
I'm using the term ""GO-manager"". It would be good if there are multiple people on this list, so the process is not coming to a halt when a person is on leave. This could be by region, but could also done globally..

**Where does the data come from and how is it maintained?**
The data for the black list should be maintained by comms GVA or the GO administrators.

"User registration: Ask for phone number in international format
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently, there doesn't seem to be any (even rudimentary) format validation or sanitization of the phone number field in the user registration form. E.g. this is considered a valid phone number by GO: `+358(0)555-86.43/23`.

### Current Situation
Currently, our `go-web-app` monorepo's build process involves a cumbersome two-step manual execution. Initially, we build `go-ui` utilizing the Vite library mode, followed by the building of `go-web-app` itself using Vite. 
Additionally, we lack the capability to automatically detect and incorporate changes in `go-ui`, necessitating manual intervention for each update.

### Proposed Solution
To address these challenges and enhance our development workflow, I propose leveraging advanced build tools tailored for monorepo environments.

"Add TypeScript Type Check along with API Schema Validation
To ensure the reliability and consistency of our codebase, we should add steps in our CI pipeline to perform TypeScript type checking for the frontend, validate the backend API schema, and generate/check TypeScript types from the OpenAPI schema using `openapi-typescript`. This will help catch type errors and schema inconsistencies early in the development process, improving code quality and reducing potential runtime errors.

### Acceptance Criteria
-  TypeScript type checking runs successfully as part of the CI pipeline.
-  API schema validation runs successfully as part of the CI pipeline.
-  TypeScript types are generated from the OpenAPI schema and type-checked as part of the CI pipeline.
-  CI pipeline fails if any type errors or schema validation errors are detected.
-  Documentation is updated to reflect the new type-checking and schema validation steps in the CI process.

"[PROD] Not-Open Surge alerts are not going through GO
We finally discover the issue!!! After having a conversation with the new focal point for RRMS in the Surge team, it seems that the alerts that are not making into GO, were created without an OP tag, and the OP tag was only added when those alerts were not open anymore (either archived or unfiled), so seems like the issue IS that we are only refreshing the Open Alerts endpoint of Molnix.

I will try to propose a meeting on Monday so we can discuss how to move forward on this one.

"IFRC Delegation Offices Data Maintenance 
Last year, we received a request from the Health & Care department for the exact coordinates of the IFRC Office delegation. The old data utilized city centroids as coordinates, which prompted us to initiate a process to collect accurate data from the regions. During this process, we discovered the absence of a systematic approach to maintaining this data and identified various sites engaging in parallel tabulation of the same information without a clear maintenance process. This has led to discrepancies across different sites citing the same data.

During the GO sprint discussion, we began an effort to identify data owners for the datasets on the GO platform but were unable to pinpoint a specific owner of the delegations offices data. We then approached the OSG, who tasked the Global IT Planning & Project Management Unit with leading this process. Their ongoing work to transition away from FedNet and ensure easy maintenance of data aligns closely with our intended goal.

This ticket will track and share the progress of this exercise. In the comments below, I will share the work done by Fiona and Jonathan in compiling similar information, which I believe will provide a solid foundation for this initiative.",https://api.github.com/repos/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/1229,-1,"[0.00937166 0.01823119 0.02050005 0.01145281 0.01557117 0.08408896

"[PROD] Emergency page blank (doesn't have emergency name or country name etc.) even though those details are there in back end
## Issue
https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/6895/ is the emergency page for Iran floods MDRIR014.  This emergency is set to **visibility = IFRC and NS**.

Currently for both public (not logged in users) and _some RC users_ the page is completely blank for Emergency Details and Reports/Documents tabs - doesn't even have an emergency name or country on the page, and doesn't show a notification of any kind re not authorised.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/654ba820-e4dd-4e5f-b4cf-2945f87a529f)
I can see that this is because the API call to https://goadmin.ifrc.org/api/v2/event/6895/ is returning 404 not found.
However it is showing surge data on the Surge tab.

IFRC users (e.g. 11560, from the region) can apparently see the data as per this screenshot:
_note I checked and this screenshot only shows data that's available in public appeal docs, so it's fine for me to put the screenshot here in public ;) _
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/092b4a3c-8e91-47a5-8277-0b4357bfb16f)

This is the emergency as linked from the [Iran Country page](https://go.ifrc.org/countries/203/ongoing-activities/emergencies).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046797c9-0913-4a41-8654-043d0fda2f56)

## Steps to reproduce
Go to https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/6895/ as a public user or an RCRC user.

## Expected behaviour
There are ~~three~~ two issues here:

~~1. if the user fits within the criteria to see a limited visibility page then they should be able to see the information.  In this case as an IFRC user then I believe that I (and other IFRC users) should be able to see the information on the emergency page (as it is set to visibility = _IFRC+NS)~~ _deleted as this is working fine_
2. conversely, if the user is _not_ within the criteria that are permitted to see a restricted visibility emergency page - e.g. because they are not logged in, or not from a relevant NS - then I believe they should see a notification onscreen about that.
3. need to check which parts of the page are restricted - currently the Surge tab is still visible publicly even though I believe that specific tab is one that should not show.

## Related feature
@tovari to link the relevant github tickets that tell us which parts of a restricted-visibility emergency should be visible to whom.
FYI the Appeals documents are public at https://www.ifrc.org/appeals?date_from=&date_to=&search_terms=&search_terms=&appeal_code=MDRIR014&search_terms=&text= so I personally don't think they need to be restricted on GO - but I am not sure of the actual original GO specs here.

"Re-validation of user-accounts: are they still eligible for access.
**After approval of an account, there is no check whether that account should still have access after some time**
*There is process for getting an account in GO. You need to have a validated email-address and if it is from a domain on the white-list you can direct access. Otherwise, it needs to be approved by the region. However, once you have access, there is no process to de-activate an account if the person (for instance) left the Red Cross, and should no longer have access anymore.*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
*Automated re-verification of email addresses. Meaning: Every so many times (e.g. half year) users will get an email in which they need to confirm their access to GO, by clicking on a link. When the email is sent, the account is set to in-active. When they click the link, the account is activated again. This should work fine for emails from the whitelisted domains. Assuming that the NS is actively de-activating accounts after people have left the organisation.*
*For email addresses not on the white-list, when the person has clicked the link to confirm continuation of access, there should also go a mail to the regional representative indicating that that specific account has prolonged his/her access. Adding to that, the person(s) with Staff Status of the respective NS where the account is from should also receive the message that the account has been prolonged. This also gives a responsibility to the NS on who has access and who not.*

*Of course there are variations of this solution. Bottomline, we need to have a process wherein we validate if users still are eligible for access to GO*

"Show cone of uncertainty, path, and affected areas for GDACS, WFP ADAM and PDC
## Task background 
We have the data related to the cone of uncertainty, path, and affected areas for GDACs, PDC, and WFP ADAM, but currently, we are not showing them in the Risk Module in the GO platform.

### Review fixes (based on Justin and Mariam's review on 30.10.2024):
- [x] Map legend: Delete the word ""Map"" from ""Map Sources"" so that it just reads: ""Sources""
- [x] In the pop-up box for GDACS storms, where it currently says ""Source: [JTWC, or NOAA or other]"" let's replace ""Source:"" with ""Forecast provider:""
- [x] In the pop-up box for both PDC and for GDACS, replace ""Exposed area"" with ""Exposed area to tropical storm or cyclone strength wind""
- [x] In the pop-up box for both PDC and GDACS where it says ""Severity"" : 1) first change the text to ""PDC Severity"" or ""GDACS Severity""; and 2) add a tool tip with a link to the source
- [ ] In the colouring of the exposed area, does this apply to future exposure, past exposure or both? At the moment, it's unclear and we need to make it clear whether its one, the other or both. 
- [ ] For storm position (at a specific date and time) as denoted by dots: this is currently not working for either the PDC or GDACS events -- nothing happens when you click on the dots

"[PROD] Country Key Indicators missing and source+date not clear
## Issue
The Rapid Needs Assessment for the Hurricane Beryl response needs certain indicators for Barbados as per [SIMS Slack thread](https://sims-ifrc.slack.com/archives/C07C4J5MLQG/p1721988646666929).

They need to know things like Total Population (incl % Male, % Female), Life Expectancy in Years, Under-five mortality rate, Population living in urban areas etc.

I was going to direct them to get some of the figures from [GO Country Page](https://go.ifrc.org/countries/75/profile/overview) however I can't refer them to GO for two reasons:

1. Life Expectancy, Literacy, Poverty, Gender Inequality Index are all blank
I can see that the first two are due to https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/571 but I'm not sure why the other two are blank
2. even for the figures that are there, the source and date are not specified.  e.g. Population is given as 124,438 - and further down it says ""Sources:  The World Bank, UNICEF, HDR"".  How do I know which of these organisations the Population figure is from?  And what date that population figure relates to?  Even if I click through to the links in the Source section it still doesn't give details of exactly where the data for these indicators comes from.

To make this section usable we need to ensure that the data is populated and the sources/dates are clearly identifiable for each indicator.

"[Usability] Appeal documents sortable on emergency pages
Hi there, at the start of an Appeal there will be only a couple of documents so sort order doesn't matter and I can just eyeball them.

However for larger appeals there are multiple pages of documents.

For some reason these days they are shown in _ascending_ date order (was that a deliberate choice???) so to get to the most recent document for e.g. [Ukraine response](https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/5854/reports) I have to click through ""next page"" several times.  When I first load the page I can't even see if there **IS** a new doc since last I looked.

Usability requests:
- add buttons to the table so the user is able to _sort_ the Appeal docs by the various fields (date, location, description etc.)
- ideally also add ability to _filter/search_ by the relevant fields in the table also
- if it wasn't deliberate to start with the oldest doc, suggest reversing the table order so most recent shows first.

Thanks!

"[PROD] ""Oops! Looks like we ran into some issue!"" Invalid regular expression: invalid group specifier name
A user has emailed the IM mailbox reporting an issue when trying to open the log-in page - as per screenshot, the screen shows

> Oops! Looks like we ran into some issue!
> Invalid regular expression: invalid group specifier name
> and a bunch of stuff about moduleEvaluation@[native code]

The user reports that they were using Safari.
They subsequently tried loading GO using Google Chrome and could access it fine.

The user is therefore not blocked  - and I have only seen it from one user - however thought it worth logging a ticket in case this is something that needs to be fixed.

**Operation Overview**
- [x] Emergency appeal planned: Hide this field
- [x] Upload map: Hide this field
- [x] Type of Onset: Let's keep this field but it should default to ""Sudden"", no option to be changed
- [x] Disaster Category: Hide this field
- [x] If available please upload Crisis categorization Analysis: Hide this field


**Event Detail** ---> Replace name with ""Scenario Analysis""

- [x] Previous Operations: Hide the whole section
- [x] Description of the Event: Hide the whole section, only Total people at risk and Sources of information will remain visible
- [x] Add new question: When and where is the hazard expected to happen? : Guidance: Narrative including Date and geographical areas
- [x] Add new question: Explain the underlying vulnerabilities and risks the hazard poses for at-risk communities?  : Text. Guidance: Based on comparison of past events, what humanitarian impacts do you expect? Of what magnitude? (e.g. last time there was a cyclone making landfall with this windspeed, XX houses were destroyed, and we had to launch a DREF/emergency appeal for CHF xxx) 
- [x] Add new space to attach documents: Upload any additional support document (Optional)


**Action/Needs** ---> Hide the whole section


**Operation**
- [x] Hide the whole section, only ""Total Targeted Population"" section and ""Will surge personnel be deployed?"" will remain visible.
- [x] Add new space to attach documents: ""If the National Society has developed contingency plans, or recently carried out PER assessment or readiness check for instance, kindly attached those documents here""
- [x] Add new question: Which of the expected severe humanitarian impacts of the hazard are your actions addressing? Why were these impacts chosen? --> Guidance: Prioritized impact of the foreseen disaster
- [x] Add new section: ""Proposed actions"", this section will be similar to ""planned interventions"" in the other forms, but the grouping wont be by sector (Shelter, Health, etc) but by type of intervention, there will be only two boxes, ""Early Actions"" and ""Early Response"", with Activities (we want to find a way to ""tag"" each one of the activities with sectors) and budget, some extra rows at the end, please see picture attached below (please note that the sub-total should be a sum of the budgets, it should ALWAYS total 75k, so we can add some logic and a warning if it is not matching)

- [x] Home Page > Prioritization of excerpts > Summaries for large amount of data when prioritising recent operations focused only few or one operation . Methodology-wise, we are prioritizing excerpts according to date (after per component).

Not all sources of a secondary summary are displayed, even if one can see the sources in the excerpts pop up view.

## Bugs
### Low priority
- [ ] Home Page > Secondary summaries > After some queries (e.g. learnings in 2021), there are no secondary summaries neither for sectors, neither for components. But there are primary summaries, which means there are learnings (and each learning has at least a related component). I know, we are not displaying secondary summaries for learnings in the ""ns-specific areas of intervention"" component, but it seems the learnings displayed were related to other components.
- [x] Home Page > Introduction - Secondary summaries > At the bottom of the primary summary there is the disclaimer of how many excerpts were prioritized out of how many available. However, then, we show the number of excerpts for the secondary summaries, without any context of whether that is the number of excerpts available, prioritized or cited.
- [x] Home Page > Source > In some filters, just as ""Uganda"" when clicking the source for the primary summaries it crashes.
- [x] Home Page > Summaries > For translation, the first time that a query is done, it displays the results in English, even if the translation seems to happen in the backend (because the next time the same query is done, then, the translation appears immediately)
- [x] Home Page > Disclaimer > There is an error in ""consistency""

"Remove empty information fields for Flash Update Export and make image bigger or clickable
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
*When you share a Flash Update with a donor, they will get an email with a PDF in it. Same PDF which you will get if you export a Flash Update. This PDF also shows empty fields (which are not shown in the Flash Update online). 
The attachments shown (image and graphics) are shown quite small. This does not help the readability of these graphics/images*

**Describe the solution you'd like**
*Only show fields that contain information. E.g. When there are no actions taken by the RCRC, then do not show that section (instead of saying ""none""). 
Also, the image added is only shown quite small. Can we either make this bigger (so the map is actually readable), or you put a link on it so you can open the original one in a browser.*

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
*Continuing our current working model: not using Flash Update, but generating an Info Message which the HDCC department sends out themselves.*

**Additional context**

- Under ""Event detail"", the source URLs must start with ""https://"", otherwise they are marked as invalid. This might have prevented me from submitting the form previously, but at that time no specific error message/field was highlighted. When you enter the source directly in the online form, the ""https://"" appears automatically (the first row in the screenshot), but not when you import it from the file (in my case it was ""[google.com](http://google.com/)"", all the other rows in the screenshot). It might be more for the super ticket, but perhaps it's worth mentioning in the import file that the ""https://"" bit is a must.

"[PROD] Overseas territories unable to compete field reports (+ other issues related to these territories - e.g., incorrect region)
## Issue
British Red Cross overseas branches (https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/international/british-overseas-territories) are unable to complete field reports on GO, as the territory that is reporting - the GO district - is not linked to the UK or any other country, or available for them to select as an independent country. 
This was identified with recent Hurricanes in the region when they were doing preparedness activities and found they were unable to report using the “New Field Report” form. As such, if our overseas branches were hit by a hurricane, or would like to report an emergency, IFRC would not get these NS field reports via GO. 

This was first identified approx 6 months to 1 year ago. 

**In a future update to GO, could you link these territories to the UK?**

## Steps to reproduce

Field report:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b66aea6-8dc5-4b0b-9cba-0407a85bcdfa)

Example district page (Bermuda):
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60860451-d1bf-42ff-b171-e08d8c1db3bb)


## Expected behaviour

These should work similar to territories like Aruba / Netherlands. 
These territories should be able to complete report field reports independently. 


## Impact
All overseas territories, which operate as individual RC National Societies are unable to complete field reports. 
All users searching for the territory. 

## Severity
High. The overseas branch/ territory is unable to implement GO as part of their emergency business process. IFRC is unable to get field reports. 
It prevents those impacted from using the system at all, and there may be a functional impact to a field operation

## Is there a workaround?
TBC: Can IFRC provide alternatives while a territory is unable do a field report?

---

Additional information:
- Affected territories (all) are listed here: https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/international/british-overseas-territories
- We’ve found that some are linked to Europe or Americas, but then not a country.
- One (Montserrat) does have a page, but is not searchable. 
- I recognise this does restart a conversation about territories, and how they operate.
- I’ve also attached a spreadsheet which lists issues, and proposed solutions, that was shared with the GVA IM team approx. 6 months to 1 year ago. 

We’ll be more than happy to support and chat through any questions that you have!

"Receiving more notifications than expected
## Issue
*In my account page, I've set that I only want notifications for the Europe region. However, I also get notifications from new emergency-pages from other regions. *

At certain points in time we need to present not only what is on GO _right now_ (which we can capture with screenshots) but also _what was visible on GO at other points in time in the past_.


**Describe the solution you'd like**
As a pilot, initial example, we would like to show what was visible on GO -- and when -- with regard to Tropical Cyclone Chido from GDACS and from PDC. Here is a screenshot of what was available on 17.12.2024 at 15:00 CET for example:

"[PROD] intermittent issues ""Failed to fetch data"" due to CORS error
## Issue
I am using the same computer+browser+internet connection that I generally use to access GO, but today I have been getting intermittent ""Failed to fetch data"" errors even when I know there is data there - e.g. on the home page - highlighted emergencies, key figures etc.  I am logged in.

I turned on dev tools and can see an error message I've never seen before:

> Access to fetch at 'https://goadmin.ifrc.org/api/v2/event/?is_featured=true' from origin 'https://go.ifrc.org' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

The other odd thing I can see is that the user name in top right corner says ""anonymous"" - normally it should either have my name or else say ""Log in"" if I'm not logged in.  See screenshot.
Having refreshed a few times I can see that normally when I'm first go to go.ifrc.org it shows anonymous for just a short moment before displaying my name.  So it seems in this case things got stuck somewhere?
I don't think it's my internet connection as I'm on fast broadband.

"Field Report 3.0
Background

The purpose of the Simplified Reporting Session during the KL meeting was to pow wow around the following fundamental issues. 

1.	Reduce Field/Question Count:
o	Identify and eliminate redundant fields across the field report, and a new Monitoring tool from the Project 3W and Emergency 3W tools.
2.	Standardize Data Interoperability:
o	Ensure field names, data types, and formats are consistent between the platforms.
o	Create a shared field structure to ease the data transfer between tools.
3.	Use Required/Optional Fields:
o	Make fields essential for core reporting mandatory, while others are optional, reducing the burden on the users.
4.	Implement Dynamic Forms:
o	Conditional questions that only appear based on previous answers can streamline the user experience.

"Redirect not in place for Operational Learning changed navigation - and also no reference to it on the page
### Page URL

https://go.ifrc.org/preparedness#operational-learning

### Environment

Production

### Browser

Chrome (not that it's relevant)

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

The link to Operational Learning that has been disseminated in a lot of the guidance (e.g. the NS Response Capacity Strengthening job aid, the Red Cross CEA guide, the IFRC IM Strategy 2021024, the BHA grant documentation, and a huge number of other docs and presentations etc.) is https://go.ifrc.org/preparedness#operational-learning

However since the changed GO site navigation, this link does not work any more.  It simply redirects people to the Preparedness page https://go.ifrc.org/preparedness/global-summary which does not mention Operational Learning anywhere.





### Expected Behavior

I expected to be directed to the Operational Learning information (now at https://go.ifrc.org/operational-learning but formerly at the link above)

### Actual Behavior

I got navigated to a completely unrelated page with no mention of Operational Learning

### Priority

High (Major functionality is broken)

### Additional Context (Optional)

I put this as high priority, as we need to always make sure that links work reliably if we want people to be able to trust GO.  In the particular case of this link, if we want Operational Learning to be adopted then we need to ensure that people who click on a link they've been sent have some way of accessing the information they're looking for.

For this particular example, please can we either

1. ensure that the URL that has been published takes people directly to the Operational Learning page, or
2. change the Preparedness page content so that it mentions Operational Learning somewhere, and links people to the new location

"Search doesn't return the operation I'm looking for
### Page URL

https://go.ifrc.org/search?keyword=covid

### Environment

Production

### Browser

Chrome

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

I went to the search box and input ""covid"", looking for the global covid appeal/response page.  The dropdown as you type was just filled with 3Ws not with emergency operations.  Then when I clicked enter to get the full search results I had lots of different emergency pages - I think 50 of them - mostly with no associated appeal/dref, just one with a small dref - but none of the results were the CHF670M global appeal that I was looking for.  Is there perhaps a 50 item limit on emergencies in search???

### Expected Behavior

I wanted to see the _Global: COVID-19 pandemic_ emergency page in the results (i.e. https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/3972/details)

### Actual Behavior

The _Global: COVID-19 pandemic_ was not listed.  I had to go hunting for it manually.  The only reason I found it was because I happen to know that it was associated with Switzerland as a location - but that is not common knowledge.
Need to be able to find the emergency pages I am looking for.
Suggest prioritising pages with content/more recent updates, and perhaps also prioritising $$ of appeal in the search.  Especially with epidemics but also with other recurring disasters (typhoons, earthquakes etc.) it is important to be able to find the things we are looking for.

### Priority

None

### Additional Context (Optional)

There are a number of issues with search that I want to report, but as https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/1582 remains open there is no ability to report search issues that way.  Hence logging this ticket separately!

"Can't easily differentiate between which appeal document is which type
### Page URL

https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/7196/reports

### Environment

Production

### Browser

Chrome

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

If I go to the Appeal Documents for a given emergency, there is a list of documents but it's not easy to tell which one is the Emergency Appeal document itself, vs which document is the Operational Strategy or the Ops Update.

There are codes displayed - e.g. MDRPH056rea - but not a description


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1760bcc6-4334-4f5a-a446-154b8776105e)

### Expected Behavior

In the old days there used to be a description shown that clearly described what the document related to - e.g. here's a screenshot from the covid page - where it has the appeal code, the description (being a clear description of what type of document it is), and the filename of the document isn't visible :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a3767e4-a128-4372-ad13-b17a8dd45329)

And another screenshot from the Pakistan Monsoon Floods page - where again it's easy for a user to see what each document is:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bf6229e-8a56-42d1-88f1-d005cf536179)

As a user I would like to see a clear description of the document so I know what it is I am opening.  Me being me I happen to know that OS = Operational Strategy, REA = Revised Emergency Appeal etc. - but people who aren't PMER/IM/Ops generally do not know these secret codes even if they know what the documents themselves are.

### Actual Behavior

In more recent emergencies it's just the document's code that is shown onscreen (e.g. MDRPH056_EA or MDRPH056ROS) rather than the description of what the document actually is.

Note that ifrc.org/appeals _does_ have the info, it's just not being pulled onto GO:
https://www.ifrc.org/appeals?appeal_code=MDRPH056
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79650781-ab73-4989-b9a1-64aba17c7233)

I realise there have been a bunch of changes to how appeal docs work, but if we could please make the further tweak to ensure the info shown in ""Appeal type"" column shows on GO that would be great.  We can _also_ keep the info/code from the ""Orig. type"" but that's not enough in isolation.

Thanks a lot

### Page URL

### Environment

Production

### Browser

Chrome

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

As a surge person about to deploy, I went to the GO country page to get more information about the location I was shortly to deploy to.

I went to the National Society Overview/Partners page and in the IFRC Presence page it says:
Head of Country Delegation:  Alberto Bocanegra

However Alberto hasn't been head of delegation in Philippines since 2023 (i.e. more than a year ago)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d717c16-5594-46b5-b531-c7257d86cb53)

### Expected Behavior

I expected to see data that was current - or at least only a month or two out of date!

The IFRC website has the correct info - so even if there's not an automatic feed anywhere then someone can manually get it from ifrc.org regularly - or via the emails that come out from the IFRC Secretary General when new HoDs are appointed:
https://www.ifrc.org/national-societies-directory/Asia%20Pacific

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446fc31e-51a3-4ae7-a165-87bc9901ed80)

### Actual Behavior

I saw stale data.  Sanjeev Kumar Kafley is showing against Bangladesh when he moved to be HoD of Philippines in 2023.
Alberto Bocanegra is now HoD for Bangladesh.
Same for a bunch of other delegations/people - John Entwistle showing as HoD Russia/Belarus but he's now HoD for India cluster since a couple of months.
Emilie Goller showing as Romania when she's HoD Egypt now.
Atta Muhammad Murtaza Durrani showing in Iran when since mid 2024 the HoD for Iran has been Faisal Mahboob
etc.


### Priority

High (Major functionality is broken)

### Additional Context (Optional)

We need to either

1. make sure the data is kept up to date so that GO can be trusted,
OR

2. stop showing this field on GO and simply link people back to the relevant ifrc.org regional page instead (e.g. https://www.ifrc.org/national-societies-directory/MENA or https://www.ifrc.org/national-societies-directory/Asia%20Pacific etc. )

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

I wanted to find the information about recent emergencies in Philippines (they had 6 typhoons come through within the last couple of months of 2024, I am deployed as surge).
I navigated to the Philippines page https://go.ifrc.org/countries/136/ongoing-activities/emergencies
The key figs at the top show that there is 1 active Emergency Appeal.

The map at the bottom (headed ""Active Operations Map"" shows that there are 3 active operations - and below the map is a list of them.

However the main data section at the top of the page (under the key figures - the section with the heading ""Active Operations"" and the right hand side link ""View all emergencies in this country"") says **Data is not available.**

This ""no data available"" is the first thing other than key figs that you see.

This is unexpected, as right now there is a [very large emergency operation that is still in the early months](https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/7196/reports) (still in the surge period) so should definitely be shown.  There are also other operations ongoing with this NS that aren't mapped to the Emergency Appeal.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf08c38b-8534-41e0-875d-97d16520d2e3)

I have looked in dev tools and can see that the date is restricted to disasters starting in the last month - why is it only a month?
https://goadmin.ifrc.org/api/v2/event/?countries__in=136&disaster_start_date__gte=2025-01-05T16%3A00%3A00.000Z&ordering=-disaster_start_date

### Expected Behavior

I expected to see the responses that are currently ongoing

### Actual Behavior

I did not see any responses listed in the top section (the first bit you see onscreen)

The label does not match the real life situation.

I think the intention is to show _recent_ responses rather than _active_ responses - and at the moment responses that are <3 months old AND active aren't showing (and they should show under either criterion!)

Suggest making this timeframe at least 6 months rather than 1 month - or possibly just go for top 10 most recent. Need to definitely get past the 4 month surge period at least (if not till the end of the operation, which is generally up to 1 year).

The point of GO is to highlight the Red Cross Red Crescent response, so it seems a shame to filter out all the good work that is going on.

Thanks

4. NS has a process to develop and approve donation protocols that communicate priority needs to the public in times of disaster and crisis.
5. NS has mechanisms to share information across levels, sectors and support services.
6. NS is aware of IFRC's role in the shelter cluster coordination.
7. Branches have system to communicate and coordinate with CDRTs.
8. NS has a dedicated PMER function for emergency operations with adequate human and financial resources.
9. NS operates a M&E system at the field level to collect, manage and report on data to branch, country and IFRC offices against the set objectives of the operation.
10. NS has approved adapted Finance and Admin emergency procedures that comply with national laws and IFRC practices to rapidly support operations.
11. NS incorporates response volunteers from relevant sectors to maintain a diverse workforce.

(or alternatively could just leave out the world 'Emergency')
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/666746f1-ac8a-4eeb-980e-bf8b46ad8b39)

Similarly if I hit the button to bookmark a page in my browser I then have to manually edit the bookmark so I know which emergency it relates to.

Apart from ease of use in browsers, the other good thing is that when people copy and paste the link into other systems (e.g. Microsoft Word, when publishing Ops Updates -or Outlook when emailing) then the full emergency name will automatically appear as the hyperlink wording.  Currently if I copy and paste the URLs for several emergencies I then have to manually edit the hyperlink text so people can tell the difference between my links

### Additional Context

This is not critical but is another one of those small tweaks our side that would be very helpful to de-frictionize GO adoption by users.
It's not just me - I've noticed others (e.g. PMER) have the copy/paste URL friction - so be great to switch it up!

Ideally same for regional pages (having the region in the tab name instead of just `IFRC GO - Region`

Country pages already have the country in the browser tab name so that is fab.

"Redirect not in place for Field Reports changed navigation and COVID sankey 404
### Page URL

https://go.ifrc.org/reports/all

### Environment

Production

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

I was looking at the World Disasters Report 2022 - https://www.ifrc.org/document/world-disasters-report-2022 - as it's required reading for a university short course I'm doing just now - and the World Disaster Report references IFRC GO a number of times.

In particular, the report has several references to the global COVID-19 page https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/3972 - so I've been looking at that page again for the first time in a while.

There are several broken internal links from that main COVID page - presumably due to the site redesign?  Or perhaps another reason.  

1. on front screen of that emergency it says ""Please see also [field reports](https://go.ifrc.org/reports/all)"" - but that link to /reports/all gives me a 404
2. on actions tab of that emergency it has an embedded link to https://go.ifrc.org/covid19-3w-sankey which is also returning a 404

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a9058e-0256-46c2-8beb-d7a40e582e62)

May you please kindly make sure that these links both go to the place they were intended?  Thanks a million.

### Environment

### Browser

### Operating System

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

Two flash updates have been issued from the Philippines in the last few days.  Each time I was told by a colleague via a manual email (nothing to do with GO) so I went to GO to look for the information.

I am logged in as an IFRC User (country admin for Philippines)

If I go to the Country Page for Philippines there is no mention of the Flash Updates

If I use the search then neither of the flash updates are returned in the search.
e.g. https://go.ifrc.org/search?keyword=shear
returns
- 5 Projects from various countries from various years, none of which have the word Shear anywhere in the title
- 5 Reports, two of which have the word Shear in the title but three of which don't - all from at least a year ago if not more
- 5 emergencies, two of which have the word Shear in the title but three don't
No Flash updates are returned in search - where I was expecting to see https://go.ifrc.org/flash-updates/363 (... Effects of Shear Line...)


e.g. (2) https://go.ifrc.org/search?keyword=dengue
returns
- 1 province from Cote d'Ivoire
- 5 Field Reports and 5 emergencies (all of which are correctly mentioning Dengue)
- 5 Projects - all for emergencies that have Dengue in the name which is good (the projects themselves don't have Dengue in the title)
- 5 open surge alerts (all for Dengue)

Ideally I could search for ""Dengue Philippines"" and find https://go.ifrc.org/flash-updates/364 (Dengue Outbreak in Quezon City, Philippines)


The only way I can find that i can get to Flash Updates without having been provided with a direct link is to go to the menu Respond/Emergencies/Ongoing Emergencies, click on that link then scroll down the page to the Flash Updates section



### Expected Behavior

I expected to be able to easily find the Flash Updates, from either the Country page or from Search (when logged in as an IFRC user with admin privileges for that country)

### Actual Behavior

I had to either be given the direct link or navigate via the https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies page

"URGENT - GO emergency page incorrectly being renamed
### Page URL

https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/7196/details

### Environment

Production

### Browser

Chrome

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

This emergency page has been in place for some time, and - whilst it was originally named **Philippines - Cyclone Kristine - 2024**, the operation/response rapidly expanded to cover six typhoons over a period of several months, so the emergency page was subsequently correctly manually renamed to **Philippines: Typhoons and Floods - 2024** and has happily remained that name for some months now even when the emergency page was edited.

However, yesterday the emergency page was edited for the first time since last Friday's release, and whilst the PMER person was solely uploading a sitrep document (i.e. not making any changes to the main body of the page or other fields), after she saved the page renamed itself to **PHL: Cyclone - 02-2025 -**, which is incorrect.

This is incorrect on multiple levels:

1. The new automatic name implies the Typhoons happened in **Feb 2025** when actually they happened in **2024** - this is for sure a bug, as the auto rename seens to be taking the date the page is edited rather than the date of the event.
2. Why is the emergency page being renamed anyway?  The original name (Philippines Typhoons and Floods 2024) was the correct name for the operation as per the appeal documents etc.  There was no intention by the operation to change the name, we would like it changed back please.
3. (typo) Why does the new automatic name structure have a - on the end with nothing after?

My PMER colleague has today gone in to edit the emergency to change the name back to what it should be, but again her change is overwritten to the automatic name - so there is no workaround for us to fix this operation ourselves.

I have looked at the issues in the [go-web-app@7.11.1 Release Note](https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/releases/tag/go-web-app%407.11.1) and think it must relate to changes made for https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/1382 and in particular sub-ticket https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-api/issues/2266

However in that ticket it clearly states that `For existing Emergencies, the title field will remain empty, and the summary will retain its current value.` - which I read to mean that for existing emergencies nothing should change unless we want it to.  Which is clearly not the case.

To reproduce this issue:

- click on the ""edit emergency"" button on the front end of an emergency page in GO (in this case, https://go.ifrc.org/emergencies/7196/details)
- it takes you to the admin site (in this case, https://goadmin.ifrc.org/en/admin/api/event/7196/change/)
- change something (not the title) - in this case we uploaded a sitrep
- click save
- you will see that the emergency title has been automatically renamed (on both front end and back end) to have country code + Disaster Type + *today's* month and year (rather than the month and year the emergency happened)

### Expected Behavior

I expected the emergency page title to stay the same when no-one had edited the title

### Actual Behavior

The emergency page title changed to an incorrect one.

"new naming convention - impact on search - being able to find the emergency I'm looking for
Hi there, under https://github.com/IFRCGo/go-web-app/issues/1688 there is a conversation re the new structure that has been put in place for auto-naming emergencies according to a pre-specified format.

Separate to the question around whether this design caters well for all necessary scenarios, I wanted to check in specifically about **search** under the new design.

If the desired wording (e.g. the country, or the specific location) is no longer present in the title and it is instead a country ""code"", will the Search functionality be made smart enough to allow the user to find it still with the country name?

e.g. if I search for ""Philippines Typhoons"" I want this to still come up in search even though the title now has ""PHL"" instead of ""Philippines"":  
`PHL: Cyclone - 10-2024 - Typhoons and Floods`

I am not sure if this is a new requirement (in which case it is urgent) or if it has already been thought about.  But it is critical if changing the structure of the name.

"Info ticket:  disaster type categorisation considerations
Hi there, I think there is already at least one ticket for this but I can't find it this moment, so documenting afresh.  Not requesting a specific action under this ticket, just writing it down for those who aren't already aware.  I don't have access to the internal GO team documents - there is also documentation there, which may supplement this post.

**Disaster Types are not always consistent - not even internally consistent within the structured data fields that relate to that particular operation, let alone consistent with the wording chosen to be used for public facing documentation.  Need to resolve approach to this before considering which field to do any structured naming off**

At the moment there is a disaster type for the *appeal/DREF* and a disaster type for the *emergency/event* (bearing in mind not all emergencies have an associated appeal/DREF).  These two don't always match.  Sometimes because the categorisation decision at the point of creating a field report (informal) is not the same as the categorisation decided-on when launching a formal DREF/Appeal.

In other cases they are both aligned at the outset, but the categorisation changes over time (and not all systems are necessarily updated to reflect that changed decision - in the same way that when an appeal is first set up it might not have its name changed in IFRC Financial Systems even when its name is changed in public-facing systems such as GO emergency page).

In still other cases the situation might correctly have multiple relevant categorisations - e.g. where a complex emergency in one country causes a population movement in other countries, with separate operations, but there's a multi-country public-facing appeal set up that covers the whole response.

Similarly, the country/location used in the IFRC Financial Systems as being responsible for the appeal might not be the country/location where the action is actually happening - e.g. Ukraine response appeal was in the IFRC financial systems as Hungary as that's the regional office.  The global Covid response appeal was in the IFRC financial systems as Switzerland (even though in the early days it was a China/Asia response, that later became a global one).

**So, for all these reasons, if deciding to automatically name an emergency page based on data fields then need to be sure the logic is referencing the correct data fields.  Noting that not all data fields are always updated in the same way - financial and reporting systems often need different data to public-facing comms**.


Here are examples where the emergency disaster type is different to the appeal disaster type for that emergency - for appeals that are currently at status active on GO.  Some of these may be due to human error, others definitely are not.

To show you the front end, this is MDRHN024 (Honduras) on GO - on the emergency page it's a cyclone/tropical storm, in the appeal that that emergency is mapped to it is a Flood.

"DREF Superticket 2.0 (New features)
### Feature Description

New features for the DREF process!

**DREF Application**

_Risk considerations (these changes also need to be in Ops Update and Final Report)_ 
- [ ] In Operation Section > Risk and Security Considerations change title to ”Risk and Security Considerations (including “management”)” 
- [ ] In Operation Section > Risk and Security Considerations, the field title “Please indicate about potential operational risk for this operations and mitigation actions” change to “Please analyse and indicate potential risks for this operation, its root causes and mitigation actions.” And add the description: “When identifying the risks, please review the IFRC Risk Management Policy and Framework including the different risk categories. When possible, make sure that your identification of risks includes some analysis of previous incidents and performance of the NS in previous operations.”  
- [ ] In Operation Section > Risk and Security Considerations, under the field  “Please analyse and indicate potential risks for this operation, its root causes and mitigation actions.” add a link to the “Annex III -Risk Categories.pdf” [Annex III – Risk Categories (1).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18903662/Annex.III.Risk.Categories.1.pdf)
 
_PGI considerations (these changes also need to be in Ops Update and Final Report)_ 

- [ ] Under Event Details > Description of Event, under the field “total affected population” add the following with numbers field: 
- “Estimated male” 
- “Estimated female” 
- “Estimate minors” 
- [ ] Under Event Details > Previous Operations add a field with title: “Did you complete the Child Safeguarding Risk Analysis in previous operations, what was risk level?” With a yes or no box, and short text box to add the risk level. 
- [ ] Under Operation Section > Risk and security considerations at the start, add the title “Does your National Society have:” and the options with a yes or no box:  
- anti-fraud and corruption policy,  
- prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse policy,  
- child protection/child safeguarding policy,  
- whistleblower protection policy,  
- anti-sexual harassment policy? 
- [ ] In Operation Section > About support services, after the question “How many staff and volunteers will be involved in this operation“ add the following question “Does your volunteer team reflect the gender, age, and cultural diversity of the people you’re helping? What gaps exist in your volunteer team’s gender, age, or cultural diversity, and how are you addressing them to ensure inclusive and appropriate support?”, with the description “This question is about making sure your team includes the right mix of people to best support those affected. For example, if you’re helping single female heads of households, it’s important to have enough female volunteers to make everyone feel comfortable and understood. Including team members who share the same language or cultural background as the people you’re helping can also make a big difference in building trust and providing effective support.”
- [ ] In Operations timeframe and Contacts > Tracking Data and Contacts add “National Societies’ Integrity focal point”  details, and “National Society’ Hotline” (only phone number) 

_General changes_
- [ ] Under Operation overview > Essential information, can we replace the description text to: “If a field report related to this event/operation already exists, you can use it to pre-fill matching fields in this request. To do so, select the relevant field report from the drop-down list and click “Copy”.
- [ ] Under Operation overview > Essential information, “Emergency appeal planned”, delete this field
- [ ] Under Operation overview > Sharing, add the bottom to share the application in this box and remove from above the form, also, when the operation is not saved, still show the bottom and allow user to share and when accepting, confirm with the user that the application will be saved first to allow sharing. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17af961f-be67-4334-a3e2-8bac1d2d7513)
- [ ] Under Operation > Planned Intervention: Include a link to the budget summary template.
- [ ] Under Operational Timeframes and Contact, at the very bottom of the page, can we add a highlighted Save button, and remove continue as is not functional here.

- [ ] Event detail > Description of the Event > What happened, where and when? 
- “Clearly describe: 
1. What happened: Briefly explain the nature of the emergency (e.g., flood, earthquake, epidemic). Include key details such as the intensity, and any unique aspects of the event. 
2. Where: Specify the geographic location(s) affected. Be as precise as possible, including names of countries, regions, cities, or specific areas impacted by the event. 
3. When: Indicate the date and time when the event occurred or began. If the situation is ongoing, mention that and provide relevant updates on the timeframe.”
- [ ] Actions/Needs > Other Actors Actions Related To The Current Event > National authorities . “Brief description of actions taken by the national authorities.”
- [ ] Actions/Needs > Other Actors Actions Related To The Current Event > UN or other actors . “Brief description of actions taken by the UN or other actors.”
- [ ] Actions/Needs > Needs (Gaps) Identified > Any identified gaps/limitations in the assessment 
Add guidance: “Consider the following: 
- Unmet needs: are there specific sectors (e.g., shelter, WASH, health) where needs remain unmet or only partially addressed? 
- Resource shortages: highlight any shortages in available resources (e.g., funding, personnel, supplies) that limit the ability to meet the identified needs. 
- Operational challenges: mention any operational constraints that are preventing a full response to the needs (e.g., logistical issues, insufficient capacity). 
- Coordination issues: note any challenges in coordinating with other actors or agencies that have resulted in gaps in service delivery or response coverage. 
- Vulnerable groups: identify any specific vulnerable groups whose needs may not have been fully captured or addressed during the assessment (e.g., displaced persons, elderly, people with disabilities).” 
- [ ] Operation > Objective and Strategy Rationale > Overall objective of the operation 
- “The objective statement should clearly and concisely describe the primary goal of the operation, focusing on the humanitarian impact and the specific needs the operation aims to address. 
- The IFRC-DREF operation aims to [primary action] in order to [desired impact] for [target population] affected by [event/disaster], by providing [key services/interventions] and ensuring [core outcomes such as protection, dignity, and resilience] over [operation period].”
- [ ] Operation > Objective and Strategy Rationale > Operation strategy rationale 
“Elaborate on the overall plan, strategy and approach of the operation; explain the reasoning behind the chosen strategy for the emergency operation. 
 Explain how the identified needs/gaps and actions taken/plans are linked. 
- Highlight the most urgent needs the operation aims to address. 
- Describe the main priorities and explain why these priorities were chosen based on the specific context of the emergency. 
- Justify why particular methods and actions were selected and how they are expected to achieve the desired outcomes. 
- Include any key factors that influence the strategy; mention how these factors were considered in shaping the operation.” 
- [ ] Operation > Risks and security considerations > Please indicate about potential operational risk for this operations and mitigation actions [when “Add new risk” clicked] 
“Identify up to 5 key potential risks or threats that could negatively impact the success of the operation. These can range from environmental risks to social or logistical challenges. 
- What are the primary risks that could affect the operation’s implementation? 
- Are there any context-specific risks that need to be considered? 
- How might these risks impact the operation’s objectives, timeline, or resources?” 
“Mitigation actions are actions or strategies that will be implemented to reduce or manage the identified risks, ensuring the operation can proceed as planned. 
- What specific measures or strategies will be put in place to mitigate the risks identified? 
- Will contingency plans or additional resources be required to address these risks?” 
- [ ] Operation > Risks and security considerations > Please indicate any security and safety concerns for this operation 
“Describe any specific security or safety threats that could impact the safety of personnel, volunteers, and communities during the operation. 
- Are there any security concerns related to the areas where the operation will take place (e.g., conflict zones, high-crime areas) 
- What safety risks could impact the well-being of staff, volunteers, or beneficiaries (e.g., dangerous terrain, health risks)? 
- Are there any specific security protocols or measures that need to be established or followed during the operation?”
- [ ] Operation > Planned intervention > Request Amount in CHF. -->“General funding requested to fund the interventions.” 
- [ ] Operation > Planned intervention > Request Amount in CHF [if at least one intervention selected – general description, no need to add it to each intervention] 
“List specific activities that will be carried out as part of the intervention in each sector. The activities should directly address the identified needs and align with the operation’s strategic objectives. 
- What specific actions will be taken in this sector to meet the identified needs?” 
Start by choosing indicators from the IFRC indicator databank [link] whenever possible. This makes it easier to compare and analyse results across all emergency operations. 
- Pick indicators that align with the planned activities. This ensures that the indicators accurately reflect the actions being taken on the ground. Missing important indicators could mean missed chances to showcase the positive impact of the work being done. 
- Keep in mind that more indicators can mean more work. Each indicator selected requires monitoring, tracking, and reporting, so be sure to choose the ones that best reflect the key outcomes of your actions. 
- Consider the type of indicator unit. For example, it’s often simpler and clearer to track and report on the “number of people” rather than a “percentage of people.” 
For each indicator, set a target. This helps track progress and measure whether the operation is achieving its key objectives, making it easier to report results later on.”
- [ ] Operation > About Support Services > How many staff and volunteers will be involved in this operation. Briefly describe their role. [remove “Briefly describe their role.”] 
“A brief description of the human resources that will be engaged in the operation, including both staff and volunteers. 
- How many staff members and volunteers are expected to participate? 
- What specific roles or responsibilities will they have during the operation? 
- Are there any key leadership positions or coordinators overseeing the activities?"" 
- [ ] Operation > About Support Services > Will surge personnel be deployed? [if “Yes” selected; remove “Please provide the role profile needed.” from both the general description and the text box”] 
- Describe the skills and qualifications/profile of the surge personnel or any additional staff (to be) deployed specifically for the operation. 
- What expertise or skill sets are required for the personnel being deployed? 
- What roles will these personnel fulfil? 
- Are there specific tasks or sectors they will be managing?”
- [ ] Operation > About Support Services > If there is procurement, will it be done by National Society or IFRC? [replace the currently existing description] 
“Explain the responsibility for procurement activities during the operation. 
- Who will be responsible for procurement (National Society or IFRC)? 
- Will procurement involve local or international suppliers? 
- Will it be for replenishment or for distribution?  
- If for distribution, how long is the tendering expected to take?  
- For Cash and Voucher Assistance, what is the status of the Financial Service Provider?” 
- [ ] Operation > About Support Services > How will this operation be monitored? [replace the currently existing description] 
“Describe the mechanisms that will be used to track the progress and effectiveness of the operation. 
- What systems will be used to monitor the operation's activities and outcomes? 
- How will progress be tracked, and who will be responsible for monitoring? 
- What indicators or milestones will be used to assess the success of the operation? 
- Will there be IFRC monitoring visits? How will it be deployed?” 
- [ ] Operation > About Support Services > Please briefly explain the National Societies communication strategy for this operation. [replace the currently existing description] 
“Describe how the National Society will manage internal and external communication throughout the operation. 
- What communication channels will be used to share information internally among teams and externally with stakeholders, partners, and the public? 
- How will the National Society ensure transparent and effective communication with the affected communities? 
- Is there a media strategy in place for external communication, such as press releases or social media updates? 
- Will the IFRC be supporting with communication? What roles will be involved?” 

**DREF export** 

- [ ]  Regions are described in the DREF request as “Affected Regions”, while in the DREF export, they are “Targeted Areas”, these two don’t mean the same.
[-> Same for the ops update and final report] -Targeted 
All should say “Targeted Regions”

**Ops Update and Final report (others)** 

- [ ] For Operational Update, under Event Details  Summary of changes  Display the yellow message next to their corresponding Yes/No rows? These messages should also pop up next to the fields, instead of the top of the page (across the submission form) that need to be modified. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11b58e4c-ec7e-4cf3-823a-a26b4c23eaa9)

- [ ] Similar to the DREF application form, can we have a highlighted Save button at the bottom of the page on the last page and remove continue bottom (Operational timeframes and contacts)?
- [ ] For operations update, made the input of a number in actual in the indicators mandatory, even if 0, For final report, lock the indicators title and target, as there should not be any changes at the final report stage
- [ ] For Operational Update, under Actions/needs, remove the Section about “National society Actions”.
- [ ] For Final Reports: modify the question about other actions besides the DREF.  (As describe for the Application)
- [ ] In the Operations Udpate/Summary of changes, the field “are you requesting a second allocation?” to be modified to “Are you requesting an additional allocation?” 
- [ ] In the Operations Update/ Summary of changes remove the field “Has this event materialised”

"GO DREF - Indicator bank connection
### Feature Description

We need to connect the indicator bank with the DREF process in GO. So we can move away from having free text fields but we can have more structured data.
Next steps:

- [ ] Make sure that the Sectors match with the Planned Operation - Marco, Ana and Dirk
- [ ] Devs to study the API and come up with questions if any.
